## Responsive website using HTML and CSS
This is my first time consuming project 
## Concepts used:
--> HTML
--> CSS FLEXBOX 
--> CSS NESTED FLEXBOX 
--> CSS GRID 
--> MEDIA QUERIES  

## THINGS I LEARNT 
I learned how to work on this type of complex project in which I need to make the header, content and footer for both desktop and mobile screens but I tried to make the website compatible with every screen width. I found the design on the front-end mentor website and I code it. I loved to work on the website and improved my skills by lot.

Note--> If any experienced developer is seeing my repository. Kindly give me your valuable feedback. It will help me to find my mistakes and will give me chance to improve myself more. Thank you..
